# FUTURE_ML_02
CHURN PREDICTION SYSTEM 
Objective
To build a predictive system that identifies customers likely to discontinue services, enabling data-backed decision-making for retention and revenue optimization.

🚀 Project Highlights


Performed data cleaning, preprocessing, and feature engineering on telecom customer data


Trained and compared multiple classification models — Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost


Selected the best model based on performance metrics:


Accuracy: 84%


Precision: 82%


Recall: 79%


F1-Score: 0.80


ROC-AUC: 0.88




Generated customer-level churn probability scores for visualization and business insights


Developed a Power BI dashboard to illustrate churn trends, risk segmentation, and key influencing factors



🧠 Skills & Tools
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Matplotlib, Power BI, Machine Learning, Predictive Analytics, Data Visualization, Business Intelligence

💡 Key Insights


Customers with month-to-month contracts show the highest churn rates


Electronic check payment users are more likely to leave the service


Longer tenure and annual contracts strongly reduce churn probability


Feature importance analysis highlights contract type and monthly charges as top predictors



📈 Impact
The model provides actionable insights for targeted marketing and retention strategies, helping businesses minimize churn and maximize customer lifetime value.
